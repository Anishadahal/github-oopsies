      This is an example of how dumb I get sometimes that I push secrets to
      github
    </h1>
    <p>Lets say my secret key is <i>QjfdUirew123#$fd&TUZX</i></p>
    <h3>
      So here it is! I have pushed the secrets to my remote git repository.
    </h3>
    <h1>A few decades later</h1>
    <p>
      Today is the day I realized I might have screwed up. Apparantly a few
      commits ago, I used my secret key in this file and pushed it to github. I
      should have used a dummy secret like "{replace it with your actual secret
      key}"
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, in the mean time, I also get enlighten that I have pushed a file
      full of secrets that I don't want to share with ANYONE on the internet.
    </p>
